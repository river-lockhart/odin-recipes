        Who doesn't love coleslaw? I love coleslaw. You're here so you must love coleslaw. If you can find a 
        person that doesn't love coleslaw I will personally shove some so far up their keister they'll
        be tasting it til they die and they'll have a good reason to hate it.

        live our own perfect coleslaw loving life! And what better way to do that than making some freaking
